## About Me
Hi, I'm Maksut Ismailov! I am a Front-End developer living in Motion village, Uzgen district of Kyrgyzstan.
My interest in programming suddenly took me to an 8 month web development course in 2022 and from that moment my interest in programming grew, I haven't looked back since.

I completed the 8-month Front-End course and received a certificate , then developed myself by learning more skills at home.
Front-end developer with skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js and more, looking for an entry-level position to learn and grow.

I am always patient responsible and persistent, i do everything with focus and dedication.
My goal in programming is to develop the company I work for, gain experience, improve my living conditions, get rich, and then use my experience to teach and mentor people who are interested in programming.
